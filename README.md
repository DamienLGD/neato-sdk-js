# Neato SDK JS
A javascript library to interact with Neato servers and robots via Ajax calls.

To boost your development you can also check the *sample application*.

## Before you start using the Neato SDK JS
//TODO  explain the dev he has to create an app on the Neato Developer portar in order to obtain CLIENT ID, roles, redirect url schema....

## What you cannot do with this SDK
With this SDK you cannot do these things:

 - Create the user Neato account: the user must to already have a Neato account (created from the Neato portal or from the official Neato App).
 - Link the robot to the user account (this must to be achieved through the official Neato App).

## A note about Manual Cleaning
The SDK doesn't offer a ready to use way to control manually your robot. 
//TODO how to do manual cleaning yourself

## Setup  
In order to use the Neato SDK JS simply import the *jQuery* and *hmac-sha256* dependencies and the *neato-x.y.z.min.js* file:

``` xml
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crypto-js/3.1.2/rollups/hmac-sha256.js"></script>
<script src="../lib/neato-0.1.0.min.js"></script>
```


## Usage
The Neato SDK has 3 main roles:
1. Handling OAuth authentications.
2. Simplifying users info interactions.
3. Managing communication with Robots.

These tasks are handled by two classes: `NeatoUser` and `NeatoRobot`.

### Authentication
The Neato SDK leverages on OAuth 2 to perform user authentication. 

#### 1. Retrieve your client_id, scopes and redirect_url
Before start please retrieve your *client_id*, *scopes* and *redirect_uri* you entered during the creation of your app on the Neato Developer Portal. These values must match in order to authenticate the user.


#### 2. Start the authentication flow
To start the authentication flow simply invoke the *login()* method on the user object passing the above data:

```javascript
var user = new Neato.User();
user.login({
 client_id: "your_app_client_id",
 scopes: "control_robots+email",
 redirect_url: "your_redirect_uri"
});
```

The SDK will start itself the authentication flow navigating to the Neato authentication page where the user inserts his Neato account credentials and accept your app to handle your Neato data. If the authentication is successfull you will be redirected to the redirect uri page and an *access_token* parameters will be passed into the url. 

#### 3. Check if the user is now connected

There's no need to parse the token yoursel, the SDK handle it for you. You only have to check if the user is now connected to the Neato server or not:

```javascript
var user = new Neato.User();
user.isConnected()
  .done(function () {
	//ok you can retrieve your robot list now
  }).fail(function () {
	//authentication failure or user not yet logged in
  });
```

In order to understand why the *isConnected()* method returns failure you can use these methods on the user object:

```javascript
if(user.authenticationError()) {
  //OAuth authentication failed/denied
}else if(!user.connected && user.token != null) {
  //invalid/expired token
}else {
  //nothing to do here, show the login form to the user
}
```

### Working with Users
Once the user is authenticated you can retrieve user informations using the NeatoUser class:

```javascript
user.getUserInfo()
  .done(function (data) {
    var email = data.email || "";
  })
  .fail(function (data) {
    //server call error
  });
```
#### Get user robots
To get the user robots list you can do this:

```javascript
user.getRobots()
  .done(function (robots) {
	  //now user.robots contains the NeatoRobots array
  })
  .fail(function (data) {
    //server call error
  });
```

*NeatoRobot* is a special class we have developed for you that can be used to directly invoke commands on the robot, see next.

To count the robots do this:

``` javascript
var count = user.robots.length;
```

To retrieve a specific robot by serial number do this:

``` javascript
var robot = user.getRobotBySerial(serial);
```

### Communicating with Robots
Now that you have the robots for an authenticated user itâ€™s time to communicate with them.
In the previous call you've seen how easy is to retrieve `NeatoRobot` instances for your current user. Those instances are ready to receive messages from your app (if the robots are online obviously).

#### The robot status
Before we saw how to retrieve the robots list from the NeatoUser class. Is a best practice to check the robot state before sending commands to it otherwise the robot maybe in the situation he cannot accepts the command and returns an error code. To update/get the robot state do this:

```javascript
robot.connect();
```

This method start polling for the robot state every X seconds and invoke the *onStateChanged()* if a state change occurs.

So, if you are interested in these events you can do this:

``` javascript
robot.onConnected =  function () {
  console.log(robot.serial + " got connected");
};
robot.onDisconnected =  function (status, json) {
  console.log(robot.serial + " got disconnected");
};
robot.onStateChange =  function () {
  console.log(robot.serial + " got new state:", robot.state);
};
robot.connect();
```

#### Sending commands to a Robot
An online robot is ready to receives your commands like `start cleaning`. Some commands require parameters others not, see the API doc for details.  

Pause cleaning doesn't require parameters:

```javascript
robot.pauseCleaning();
```

Start cleaning requires parameters like the cleaning type (clean all house or spot), the cleaning mode (eco or turbo) and, in case of spot cleaning, the spot cleaning parameters (large or small area, 1x or 2x).

```javascript
robot.startCleaning({
  category: 2,
  mode: 1,
  modifier: 1,
  navigationMode: 1
});
```

#### Working with Robot schedule

To schedule a robot clean every Monday at 3:00pm:

```javascript
robot..setSchedule({
  1: { mode: 1, startTime: "15:00" }
});
```

To schedule a robot clean every day at 3:00pm:

```javascript
robot..setSchedule({
  0: { mode: 1, startTime: "15:00" },
  1: { mode: 1, startTime: "15:00" },
  2: { mode: 1, startTime: "15:00" },
  3: { mode: 1, startTime: "15:00" },
  4: { mode: 1, startTime: "15:00" },
  5: { mode: 1, startTime: "15:00" },
  6: { mode: 1, startTime: "15:00" }
});
```

*Note: not all robot models support the eco/turbo cleaning mode. You should check the robot available services before sending that parameters.*



#### Checking robot available services

Different robot models and versions have different features. So before sending commands to the robot you should check if that command is available on the robot. Otherwise the robot will responde with an error. You can check the available services on the robot:

```javascript
var availableServices = robot.state.availableCommands;
```

In addition there are some utility methods you can use to check if the robot support the services.

```javascript
if(availableServices["findMe"]) {
  //robot has the findMe service
}
```

## Dependencies

 * [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) (> 2.2.0)
